# Crop_Leaf_Disease_Detection
Image classification of crop leaf diseases using a CNN trained with TensorFlow, deployed via Streamlit.
## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload crop leaf images and detect diseases instantly
- Built with **TensorFlow** and **Streamlit**
- Custom-trained CNN model on categorized crop disease images


##ðŸ§ª HOW IT WORKS

Load trained model (.keras or .h5).
Preprocess input image (resize, normalize).
Predict using model.predict().
Display predicted class and confidence.

##ðŸ§  MODEL INFORMATION
